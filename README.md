>it's only working in Google chrome, because Chrome currently takes the audio and sends it to Googleâ€™s servers to perform the transcription. This is why speech recognition is currently only supported in Chrome only.and some Chromium based browsers. like Microsoft Edge.

# wasdom-ESP32
i'm going to write algorithm for running wasdom ESP32.
So here i'm going to apply some steps to run wasdom ESP32 with Arduino.



### First step

you need to download Arduino IDE by [clicking here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).

### Second step

now since the wasdom ESP32 is undefined so you need to define it with Arduino by clicking on  `file > preferences`

now in `Additional Boards Manager URLs` put this URL then press `OK` . 
```
https://dl.espressif.com/dl/package_esp32_index.json
```

now move to `Tools > Board: "Arduino uno" > Boards manager` , maybe board option has a diffrent name but thats okay.

then you will get a window, type in the search bar "ESP32" then press install

#### now after these steps when you go to `Tools > Board: "Arduino uno"` you should find `ESP32 Arduino`.

### Third step

now connect wasdom ESP32 with your computer, then go and choose `wemos D1 mini ESP32`

then connect it by clicking on:

### Fourth step

now we want to make sure that everything is working so we are going to make the LED turn on and off `Blink`.
by going to `file > examples > Basics > Blink`.

after that run it then we are done. :sunglasses:
